##Bank Telemarketing Analysis

# Introduction:
This project analyzes the Portugese Bank Marketing Dataset. This dataset is about the direct phone call marketing campaigns,
which aim to promote term deposits among existing customers, by a Portuguese banking institution from May 2008 to November 2010.

The purpose of the project is to identify main factors that contribute to the success of a campaign and successfully predict if a
client would subscribe to a long-term deposit, using various classifications models. This project will enable the bank to understand 
its customer base and devise better marketing plans in the future to increase client subscription to its long-term deposit service.
